# Claudian Plus Roadmap

Claudian Plus is a Codex-first fork of Claudian for local-first knowledge work in Obsidian.
The fork keeps provider compatibility while making Codex the default agent runtime.

## Product principles

- Keep the agent runtime, model selection, retrieval, and UI context layers independent.
- Preserve existing Claudian conversations and provider-owned history files.
- Keep search indexes local by default and make every retrieved fact traceable to a source.
- Reuse the existing `@file` and `@folder/` context semantics instead of creating a second attachment model.
- Discover Codex models through `model/list`; a preferred model must remain a fallback, not a hard capability claim.

## Milestones

### M0: Codex-first foundation

- Enable Codex for new installations.
- Select Codex as the settings and blank-tab provider.
- Prefer `gpt-5.6-sol`, while retaining dynamic model discovery and custom model support.
- Keep stored settings and existing Claude conversations unchanged during upgrades.
- Give the enhanced build a separate plugin identity before live side-by-side testing.

### M0.5: Codex floating conversation outline

- Render user prompts and assistant Markdown H1-H3 headings as a compact outline rail.
- Preview each section on hover or keyboard focus and jump to it without losing chat state.
- Track the active reading section and follow the current provider's theme color.
- Collapse to the existing directory control in narrow or touch-oriented layouts.

### M1: Drag notes and folders into chat — MVP delivered

- Accept Obsidian file-explorer drag payloads in the composer.
- Route notes through the current file attachment flow.
- Route folders through the current `@folder/` context flow.
- Show an active drop target, resolve only Vault-owned paths, and reject unsupported payloads explicitly.

### M2: Conversation search — metadata MVP delivered

- Add instant title filtering to the history panel.
- Search title, first-message preview, and Provider without touching provider-owned transcript files.
- Add a provider-neutral local full-text index for user and assistant messages (next iteration).
- Support date, provider, and model filters with direct navigation to a matched message.
- Delete index records when a conversation is removed.

### M3: Hybrid vault retrieval — local MVP delivered

- Incrementally index Markdown blocks by path, heading, modification time, and content hash.
- Combine lexical overlap with heading/path/link/recency boosts; embeddings and optional reranking are next.
- Give explicit context, the current note, and linked notes predictable priority.
- Return clickable block-level citations and expose index privacy controls.

### M4: Insight engine — source-backed entry point delivered

- Surface related older notes, topic evolution, and useful follow-up questions.
- `/insight` now builds a source-grounded prompt with numbered citations and an explicit uncertainty check.
- Start with user-triggered reviews before adding optional scheduled discovery.
- Learn from useful, not useful, and mute-topic feedback.

## Verification baseline

Before each milestone is merged:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm run test
npm run build
```

The upstream repository currently has Windows-specific baseline failures in path-mocking unit tests and the
architecture-boundary path matcher. New work must not increase that known failure set.
